# Rocket-game-using-pygame
This project is a simple space shooter game developed using Pygame. The player controls a rocket, moves left and right, and shoots bullets to destroy incoming demons. Features include score tracking, collision detection, and a game over screen with a restart option. It's an engaging way to practice basic game development concepts with Pygame.
